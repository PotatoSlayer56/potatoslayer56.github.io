      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Josh, a 17 year old from Australia entering his final year of high school.
        I fell in love with programming when I was 10, when a friend showed me how to create shapes with turtle in python.
        Ever since then I have been tinkering with small python projects and more recently exploring the world of Minecraft mods using java.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        My first mod, ArmourHUD was a bigger success than I could ever hope for, getting over 17 thousand downloads across only 2 years.
        This inspired me to go further and create a small pvp client named PotatoClient, however this has not performed as well as I had hoped.
        I plan to add more to the mod, and hopefully further it's outreach through that process.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        When I'm not coding or at school, I enjoy playing games with my friends.
        I mainly play Minecraft, enjoying both casual SMPs, and competitive pvp.
        I am not great at building, mainly sticking to the techinal side, making small redstone contraptions and small farms,
        however I have tried to recently start building more in an attempt to not have my houses be a collection of chests and workstations for half the playthrough.
        When playing competitive, I specialise in crystal pvp, a mode where players try and kill eachother with end crystals.
        These fights generally don't last longer than 60 seconds but can be over in less than 5.
        My average skill has placed me at Low Tier 4 on the PvPTiers tierlist.
